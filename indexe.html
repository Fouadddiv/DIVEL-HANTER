Entering the world of darkness:

<p><b>My name is Abdul Rahman, a simple boy, a high school student
    I live the life of any ordinary blind person in a family consisting of my father, mother, and four brothers<br/>One day my family was involved in an accident where a portal opened to another world and strange creatures began kidnapping my family one by one until the day came when the portal opened one last time and kidnapped me into the portal and here my story began.<br/>  When I arrived in that world called (DARK WORLD), I began searching for a way to get out of this world, then I found a manuscript in which was the following: (You must defeat the leader of the dark creatures, ZaidYouss, and in order to reach him, you must defeat all his followers.)<br/>Or did I forget to mention to you that in this world you turn the world upside down, where the blind becomes sighted and vice versa. After I finished reading that manuscript, I began to think about a way to defeat this enemy.<br/>
    While I was walking in one of the mountains, I found a hut inhabited by an old man whose appearance seemed to have signs of wisdom. Then I decided to visit him in this hut, perhaps he would show me something that might benefit me.<br/>
    After I entered, I discovered that he was human, and when I asked him why he was in this world, he answered me that it was the same reason I was here. Then I sat for a moment thinking,
    I said to myself: It seems to me from his words that he stayed here for a long time.<br/>Then I asked him: Grandpa, how long have you been here?
    He answered me, saying, "A long time ago, my son. I will go to the forest to catch something for us to eat. You stay here guarding the hut and do not try to approach any creature here until I return to you and tell you everything about this world."<br/>
    I said to him sarcastically, and from what will I guard this dilapidated hut?
    I don't see anyone here but you.<br/>
    He answered me with a smile, with only the only remaining tooth protruding from his mouth:
    It is true that I told you not to approach any creature here, except that there is another type of creature that resembles snakes but has hands and feet that resemble the hands and feet of lizards. If you leave your hut or house unguarded, they enter it and you will not be able to expel them then because they are adept at concealment and they wait for the opportunity to sleep. Then you become its prey.<br/>
    
    And then he left me a sword and went
    Then I searched for something suitable as a training puppet. After a quick turn, I found a cut tree stump. I said to myself: Good, this will do the trick. There is no doubt that this old man would not mind if I used him for training. After all, he is not a created being.
    When I approached him, the creature started attacking me
    I pulled my sword from its sheath and saw that it had begun to glow as if it had a burning fire, so I decided to try hitting that thing that looked like a stump. When I did that, my sword did not touch it. Yes, this is not strange yet, but what is strange is that the fire from my sword began to follow that thing until it burned it and it moved away from there. Quickly before the tongues of fire emanating from that sword devour him.</b></p>
